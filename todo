[x] Design basic syntax for language (keep it simple, similar to Common LISP).

[x] Write a simple tokenizer via RegEx.
    [x] Sort the generated tokens in chronological order to make building the AST easier.

[x] Create a module that handles the creation of ASTs via generated tokens using `tokenizer.py`.

[] Using the generated AST, scan through nodes and generate code for `https://github.com/Seanld/vm`.
