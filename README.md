# BetterLISP

This is a project aimed at developing a compiler for my own dialect of LISP, that generates bytecode for a VM I built (located right [here](https://github.com/Seanld/vm)). 

## Installation

Simply clone or download this repository, and then run the `install.sh` script. This will perform the installation, and you'll be set!

## WARNING!

This compiler is *very* naive. This is my first compiler project.

The bright side is that the only direction this project can go is up.
