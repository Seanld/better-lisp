# BetterLISP

A new dialect of LISP to make writing LISP code easier, and less annoying. It has more intuitive syntax and keywords that are easier to remember.

This dialect of LISP does *not* compile to machine-dependent executable binaries, but rather code for my [VM](https://github.com/Seanld/vm).

You can run this compiled VM code if you've installed the runtime for it (grab it over at the afore-linked repository).
